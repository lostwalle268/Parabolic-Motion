# Parabolic Motion Simulator with Streamlit

This is an interactive parabolic motion simulator developed with Streamlit and Plotly. It allows you to visualize the trajectory of a projectile and compare different trajectories.

## Features
- Configuration of speed, angle, initial height, gravity, and mass.
- Interactive graphs for trajectory and energy (kinetic, potential, and total).
- Comparison between two trajectories.
- Display of velocity vectors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Numpy
- Pandas

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install streamlit plotly numpy pandas
```

## How to Run
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will automatically open in your web browser.
